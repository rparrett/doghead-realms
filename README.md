Doghead Realms
==============

My brother found this on an old floppy disk. It was written by an 11 year old version of myself nearly 16 years ago in September of 1997. It appeared to be unfinished and un-named, but came with a text file full of snippets of BASIC named doghead.txt. Save files are written with the file extension '.dog'. The game welcomes the user to "the realms." So I've decided to call this "Doghead Realms." Enjoy.
